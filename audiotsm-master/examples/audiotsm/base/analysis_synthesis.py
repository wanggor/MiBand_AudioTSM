The :mod:`audiotsm.base.analysis_synthesis` module provides a base class for
real-time analysis-synthesis based audio time-scale modification procedures.

class AnalysisSynthesisTSM(TSM):
    """A :class:`audiotsm.base.tsm.TSM` for real-time analysis-synthesis based
    time-scale modification procedures.

    The basic principle of an analysis-synthesis based TSM procedure is to
    first decompose the input signal into short overlapping frames, called the
    analysis frames. The frames have a fixed length ``frame_length``, and are
    separated by ``analysis_hop`` samples, as illustrated below::

                 <--------frame_length--------><-analysis_hop->
       Frame 1:  [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
       Frame 2:                  [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
       Frame 3:                                  [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
       ...

    It then relocates the frames on the time axis by changing the distance
    between them (to ``synthesis_hop``), as illustrated below::

                 <--------frame_length--------><----synthesis_hop---->
       Frame 1:  [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
       Frame 2:                         [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
       Frame 3:                                               [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
       ...

    This changes the speed of the signal by the ratio ``analysis_hop /
    synthesis_hop`` (for example, if the ``synthesis_hop`` is twice the
    ``analysis_hop``, the output signal will be half as fast as the input
    signal).

    However this simple method introduces artifacts to the signal. These
    artifacts can be reduced by modifying the analysis frames by various
    methods. This is done by a ``converter`` object, which converts the
    analysis frames into modified frames called the synthesis frames.

    To further reduce the artifacts, window functions (the ``analysis_window``
    and the ``synthesis_window``) can be applied to the analysis frames and the
    synthesis frames in order to smooth the signal.

    Some TSM procedures (e.g. WSOLA-like methods) may need to have access to
    some samples preceeding or following an analysis frame to generate the
    synthesis frame. The `delta_before` and `delta_after` parameters allow to
    specify the numbers of samples needed before and after the analysis frame,
    so that they are available to the ``converter``.

    For more details on Time-Scale Modification procedures, I recommend reading
    "`A Review of Time-Scale Modification of Music Signals`_" by Jonathan
    Driedger and Meinard MÃ¼ller.
